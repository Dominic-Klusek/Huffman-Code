# Huffman-Code
This was a program which was made for my Advanced Algorithms course during my Spring 2020 term at <strong>CUNY College of Staten Island</strong>.

<h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Load character and frequency data from 'data.txt' file.</li>
  <li>Place character and frequency data into a MinHeap.</li>
  <li>While tree has > 1 node on it; delete two node and create a huffman node and place back onto MinHeap tree.</li>
  <li>Get final Huffman Tree. (similar to image below)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Huffman Tree Example</h2>
