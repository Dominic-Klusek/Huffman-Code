# Huffman-Code
This was a program which was made for my Advanced Algorithms course during my Spring 2020 term at <strong>CUNY College of Staten Island</strong>.

<ol>
  <strong>Algorithm Steps</strong>
  <li>Load character and frequency data from 'data.txt' file.</li>
  <li>Place character and frequency data into a MinHeap.</li>
  <li>While tree has > 1 node on it; delete two node and create a huffman node and place back onto MinHeap tree.</li>
  <li>Get final Huffman Tree.</li>
</ol>
